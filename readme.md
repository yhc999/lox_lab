# lox_lab

ðŸ“˜ A simple repository for practicing the [Lox language](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html).

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository

This repo contains various simple code examples written in the Lox programming language. 

## ðŸ§  What Is Lox?

Lox is a small dynamic programming language created by Robert Nystrom in his book *Crafting Interpreters*. It is:

- Dynamically typed;
- Syntax-wise similar to JavaScript or Python;
- Object-oriented (supports classes and methods);
- Supports closures, lexical scoping, and more.

The book implements two interpreters for Lox:
- **jlox** â€” a tree-walk interpreter in Java;
- **clox** â€” a bytecode virtual machine in C.

## ðŸ“– About *Crafting Interpreters*

> *Crafting Interpreters* is a well-known programming book that teaches how to build an interpreter from scratch.

It covers:
- Designing language syntax and semantics;
- Building a lexer and parser;
- Creating an abstract syntax tree (AST);
- Implementing environments, closures, classes;
- Writing a stack-based virtual machine and bytecode interpreter.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have built or installed a [Lox interpreter](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters):

Then just:

jlox *.lox or clox *.lox.
